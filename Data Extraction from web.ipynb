Without further knowledge, it is hard to know which dataset represents the population data and thus the generalizability of the algorithm is hard to measure. This should be mitigated by repeated splitting of train vs test dataset (as in cross validation).\\n              <br/>\\n              When there is a change in data distribution, this is called the dataset shift. If the train and test data has a different distribution, then the classifier would likely overfit to the train data.\\n              <br/>\\n              This issue can be overcome by using a more general learning method.\\n              <br/>\\n              This can occur when:\\n              <br/>\\n              P(y|x) are the same but P(x) are different.

MAE is more robust in that sense, but is harder to fit the model for because it cannot be numerically optimized. So when there are less variability in the model and the model is computationally easy to fit, we should use MAE, and if that’s not the case, we should use MSE.\\n              <br/>\\n              MSE: easier to compute the gradient, MAE: linear programming needed to compute the gradient\\n              <br/>\\n              MAE more robust to outliers.

This is desirable in inference because the goal is to explain the dataset as accurately as possible. However, this is not always desirable for data analysis or predictive modeling as there is the bias variance tradeoff. We sometimes want to prioritize the generalizability and avoid overfitting by reducing variance and thus increasing bias.\\n              <br/>\\n              OTHER Important Data Science Interview Questions and Answers\\n             </p>\\n            </div>\\n            <h4 class=\"slide_toggle\">\\n             <a href=\"#\">\\n              Q74.

      "maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given observations, by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters. MLE can be seen as a special case of the maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters, or as a variant of the MAP that ignores the prior and which therefore is unregularized.<br/>\n",

This is desirable in inference because the goal is to explain the dataset as accurately as possible. However, this is not always desirable for data analysis or predictive modeling as there is the bias variance tradeoff.
